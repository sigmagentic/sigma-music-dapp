                What if we could turn those 9 billion fans into the world's largest music distribution network?

                With Sigma Music, artists can tap into this global fan-powered network to launch their music, go viral, and earn from their work‚Äîwithout selling
                their souls to centralized labels. For the first time, fans can also share in the success of the artists they support and get rewarded for
                spreading the music they love.
              </p>

              <p>
                This is made possible by combining AI and crypto. Together, they create a new kind of infrastructure‚Äîone that aligns incentives across all
                participants through cryptoeconomics, and scales distribution exponentially through agentic AI.

              <p>
                Sigma is built to generate real revenue‚Äîjust like Web2 platforms‚Äîbut with one big difference: we don't want to rely on selling tokens to
                survive.

              <p>
                Too many Web3 projects dump tokens for revenue. That's a short-term play and a long-term loss‚Äîfor everyone. Instead, $SIGMA is designed to grow
                our fanbase and power the world's largest music distribution network.
              </p>
              <p>
                Since we're launching fairly, even the project team has to buy tokens from the market. Our incentives are aligned with the community‚Äîwe win
