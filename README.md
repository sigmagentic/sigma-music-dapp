# Sigma Music

**Sigma Music** (https://sigmamusic.fm) is a next-gen music platform built on the intersection of music, fan engagement and AI. Built with web3 and AI technology under the hood but designed for a mainstream web2 experience, Sigma combines the best of platforms like Bandcamp and SoundCloud with powerful new monetization tools ‚Äî including tokenized music assets, AI remix licensing, and IP finance.

We believe in building in the open. This repo is part of our effort to make the future of music infrastructure community-owned and developer-friendly.

## üîß How It Works

Sigma Music consists of a performant frontend + several backend services that abstract away blockchain complexity to deliver a smooth user experience.

We integrate:

- **Solana** for compressed NFT music assets
- **SUI (Walrus)** and **IPFS/Filecoin** for storage
- **Story Protocol** for commercial IP protection & remix licensing
- **ElizaOS AI agents** for remix generation and music enhancement

When artists or AI agents create music, our backend:

1. Publishes the IP to **Story Protocol** on mainnet
2. Mints a **Solana compressed NFT** representing the music
3. Links the NFT to the IP asset on Story via metadata
4. Issues story wallets to artists and fans (behind the scenes)
5. Enables licensing, royalty distribution, and remix collaboration

Example: Try it with [TKO's music](https://sigmamusic.fm/?artist=tko)

## üß† IP Licensing via Story Protocol

Sigma Music uses a **custom Story Protocol collection** to manage IP rights:  
üîó [StoryScan Collection](https://www.storyscan.io/token/0xc192CA30dC953Be84eBbB3d37d51D84c326E3E7d)

- Each **artist** is issued a Story Mainnet wallet to own and monetize their music IP
- Each **user** who purchases or remixes music receives a Story wallet (auto-assigned)
- Wallets are non-custodial and claimable, but login is frictionless (email-based by default)

We currently use:

- **Story SDKs and API**
- **Crossmint StoryKit SDK + APIs** for IP asset registration, metadata, and licensing
- **Alchemy** for redundancy on APIs and RPCs

Currently working on integrating:

- **Yakoa's API** for content authentication of our original exclusive music

## üîÆ What's Next with Story Protocol integration

We're building the future of IP-powered music infrastructure. Coming soon:

- Port all music with commercial rights to Story Protocol IP assets
- Add in-app features for:
  - üí∞ License payments
  - üéÅ Artist tipping
  - ‚öñÔ∏è Dispute handling
  - üîÑ IP trading
  - üìà IPFi (DeFi for Music IP): pools, staking, yield for music assets

Stay tuned ‚Äî Sigma is just getting started.
